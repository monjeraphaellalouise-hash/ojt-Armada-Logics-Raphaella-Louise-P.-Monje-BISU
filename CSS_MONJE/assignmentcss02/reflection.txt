This Float 1 activity took me about 40–50 minutes to complete. I used CSS float properties
to position elements side by side and adjusted margins and padding to control spacing. At 
first, it was confusing to get the layout right, and I had to use a lot of trial and error, 
similar to adjusting flex directions, to see how the elements would behave.

By testing different values and making small changes, I was able to fix alignment issues and 
keep the layout organized. This activity helped me better understand how floats work and why 
modern layout techniques like Flexbox are easier to use.
