For this assignment, I focused on copying the given layout by breaking it into simple sections first, like the header and content areas.
I started with the HTML structure, then used basic CSS properties such as margin, padding, display, and Flexbox to position and align the 
elements. I avoided advanced positioning and followed the techniques discussed in class.

One challenge I faced was getting the spacing and alignment to match the reference design. I fixed this by adjusting margins and padding 
and using Flexbox properties like justify-content and align-items. I kept checking the layout in the browser to make sure everything looked
right. Overall, this activity helped me understand how basic CSS can be used to build clean layouts. It took me about 1–2 hours to finish.
