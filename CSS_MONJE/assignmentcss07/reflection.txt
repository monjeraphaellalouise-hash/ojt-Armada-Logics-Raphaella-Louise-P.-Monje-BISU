This project really helped me understand how HTML and CSS work together when building an actual webpage. 
I started by setting up the HTML structure first, which made the layout easier to manage before adding styles. 
Once the structure was in place, I focused on using CSS to match the Netflix-style design, especially the spacing, alignment, 
and overall look of the page. Seeing the page slowly come together made the process more satisfying and helped me understand why 
structure matters.

I also realized how important it is to be careful with CSS selectors and classes to avoid style conflicts. Some parts took longer 
than expected, especially adjusting small details like margins and hover effects, but those small changes made a big difference in 
the final output. Overall, this project improved my confidence in writing HTML and CSS and showed me how much attention to detail goes
into creating a clean and visually appealing website.
