It took me approximately one hour to complete my portfolio. One of the challenges
I encountered was organizing the different sections properly and making sure the table, form elements, 
and navigation were structured correctly. I also had to carefully adjust the layout so that the content 
looked clean and readable. I resolved these challenges by reviewing my HTML lessons, checking my code 
for errors, and applying proper semantic tags such as header, section, main, and footer. Using the W3C 
Markup Validation Service helped me detect errors and ensure compliance with HTML standards. Catching 
errors early made debugging easier and prevented larger issues later, and I will always use it to 
check my code to ensure there are no errors. Through this activity, I was able to improve my understanding 
of HTML structure and gain more confidence in building a complete web page.
