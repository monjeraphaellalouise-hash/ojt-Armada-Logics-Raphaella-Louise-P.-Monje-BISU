When I clicked a color button at first, both the button alert and the container alert showed. 
The background color changed for a moment but went back to light gray because the container click event also ran. 
This happened because the click on the button was passed up to the container.

After uncommenting event.stopPropagation(), clicking a color button only triggered the button alert. 
The container click event no longer ran, so the background color changed to the selected color and stayed that way.

event.stopPropagation() is useful in this example because it stops the button click from affecting the container. 
This allows the button to change the background color without triggering the container’s click event that resets the color.
